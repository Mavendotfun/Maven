## Introduction

Maven is revolutionizing the way on-chain agents access and utilizes computing power. Maven is providing a distributed GPU grid that enables anyone to rent compute power without the usual overhead, excessive fees, or vendor lock-in.

Maven is tackling the GPU shortage in the market, providing everyone with easy access to the necessary hardware. By leveraging underutilized hardware like gaming PCs, mining rigs, and MacBooks, Maven offers users to use $MAVEN tokens to build & deploy their own agents.
