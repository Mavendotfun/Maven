## Introduction

Maven is revolutionizing the way on-chain agents access and utilizes computing power. Maven is providing a distributed GPU grid that enables anyone to rent compute power without the usual overhead, excessive fees, or vendor lock-in.
Maven is tackling the GPU shortage in the market, providing everyone with easy access to the necessary hardware. By leveraging underutilized hardware like gaming PCs, mining rigs, and MacBooks, Maven offers users to use $MAVEN tokens to build & deploy their own agents.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Python 2.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js 23+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

> **Note for Windows Users:** [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) is required.

### Use the Starter (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza-starter.git
cd eliza-starter
cp .env.example .env
pnpm i && pnpm build && pnpm start
```
Once the agent is running, You should see the message to run "pnpm start:client" at the end.
Open another terminal and move to same directory and then run below command and follow the URL to chat to your agent. 
```bash
pnpm start:client
```

Then read the [Documentation](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/) to learn how to customize your Eliza.

### Manually Start Eliza (Only recommended if you know what you are doing)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git

# Checkout the latest release
# This project iterates fast, so we recommend checking out the latest release
git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
```

### Start Eliza with Gitpod

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/tree/main)

### Edit the .env file

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the appropriate values.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Note: .env is optional. If your planning to run multiple distinct agents, you can pass secrets through the character JSON

### Automatically Start Eliza

This will run everything to setup the project and start the bot with the default character.

```bash
sh scripts/start.sh
```

### Edit the character file

1. Open `packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts` to modify the default character. Uncomment and edit.

2. To load custom characters:
    - Use `pnpm start --characters="path/to/your/character.json"`
    - Multiple character files can be loaded simultaneously
3. Connect with X (Twitter)
    - change `"clients": []` to `"clients": ["twitter"]` in the character file to connect with X

### Manually Start Eliza

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm build
pnpm start

# The project iterates fast, sometimes you need to clean the project if you are coming back to the project
pnpm clean
```

#### Additional Requirements

You may need to install Sharp. If you see an error when starting up, try installing it with the following command:

```
pnpm install --include=optional sharp
```
