## Introduction

Maven is revolutionizing the way on-chain agents access and utilizes computing power. Maven is providing a distributed GPU grid that enables anyone to rent compute power without the usual overhead, excessive fees, or vendor lock-in.

Maven is tackling the GPU shortage in the market, providing everyone with easy access to the necessary hardware. By leveraging underutilized hardware like gaming PCs, mining rigs, and MacBooks, Maven offers users to use $MAVEN tokens to build & deploy their own agents.

## Key Features
- Distributed GPU Grid
- No Vendor Lock-in
- Tokenized System
- Support for On-Chain Agents
- Reduced Overhead and Fees

 ## Getting Started
 
Maven is a platform for running AI inference workloadsopen in new window. Currently, the best way to run inference on the Maven network is through our CLI. We'll start with a simple hello world program and afterwards build on these concepts to create a fully working endpoint.

Installing The Maven CLI

To install the Maven CLI globally, use the following command:

```
npm install -g @maven/cli
```
maven --version
```
